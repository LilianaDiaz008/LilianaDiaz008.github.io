        <div class="subheading mb-5">Front Office AssistantðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Liliana Diaz and I am a first year college student. As a first year I am very excited to network with many people within my field and beyond as well as get to know other occupations. Along with being a first year student, I am also a first generation college student. Because of this new environment with networking and having new opportunities, I take pride in meeting and growing with many people who are in the same position as me. As well as helping others get to where they want to be. I aspire to further my education alongside my career!<br><br>

        My former office experience has been with my highschool front office. During my time with this occupation I was new to the office and have grown my skills substantially. Because of my experience at my high school, I learned how to manage students' confidential files and file them according to their year and grade level. Along with filing paperwork, I was also responsible for handling new paperwork that was given in the office from teachers and students that were essential for students' records as they continue the school year. Along with this I gained experience on cooperating with students for school related purposes and guests who were here for meetings. Handing out letters for the students in the school was something I also had to take care of as an office assistant, along with making sure supplies were fully stocked. And lastly, I took a new leadership role of being a trainer for a new assistant at our office. I taught our new assistant how the office operates and if there were new changes that might be coming up soon. Because of this experience I was able to learn many new skills when it comes to an office environment and also expand my knowledge when it comes to professionalism and work ethic.<br><br>

        Currently, I am a front office assistant for an association on campus at UC Riverside. My current experience working at an office is amazing and a great place to have a social working environment. I am able to exercise my skills of online softwares and filling both online and physical paperwork. Not only is cooperation with students and professional liaison an important task at my job, but strong communication is key to operating an office, which is one of the many skills I have adapted too. I grew my skills to be organized when it comes to managing applicants status and being flexible with others while being consistent with my professionalism  As well as changing the status of an applicant and sending emails about their application status as so forth. Not only this but I have expanded my knowledge on how to handle machinery that is essential to operate an office with ease, such as high end printers and scanners, paper shredders and labelers. But most importantly, I was able to socialize with new people and gave me opportunities that I didnâ€™t have before.
